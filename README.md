Esthetics and vision :
Tubes, pipes and ducts, with moving, pulsating content going in and out of walls, connecting the important parts of the event together. Suggesting a massive and complex machinery hidden and uncharted behind the surface.
Inspired by the vision of Janus from Pushing Ice by Alistair Reynolds ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89186.Pushing_Ice )
Light difusing solution inspired by things seen at CCCamp2019 like : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECjMEaqWwAE3QXV.jpg
